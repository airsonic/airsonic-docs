title: Installing Airsonic on FreeBSD 10.3 and FreeNAS 9.10
permalink: /docs/install/example/freebsd-freenas/
---
#### Preamble

This guide will wallk you through the process of deploying Airsonic on FreeBSD either in a Jail on on the main system. The prerequisites are you have root access on your FreeBSD machine (or jail), the ip address of the machine (or jail) and the Airsonic war available at the [Airsonic github page](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic/releases).

If on FreeNAS create a standard jail in the web interface and enter the shell.

#### Install Tomcat

To run Airsonic we need a server to run it in. Log into your machine and then run these commands either as root or with sudo:

```
pkg install tomcat8 nano
```

Hit y on all prompts to complete installation of Tomcat.

#### Configure Tomcat

Edit Tomcat's user configuration file with your favourite text editor. We installed nano in step 1.

```
rm /usr/local/apache-tomcat-8.0/conf/tomcat-users.xml
nano /usr/local/apache-tomcat-8.0/conf/tomcat-users.xml
```

Copy/paste the following:

```
<tomcat-users xmlns="http://tomcat.apache.org/xml"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation="http://tomcat.apache.org/xml tomcat-users.xsd"
version="1.0">

<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<role rolename="manager-script"/>
<role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
<role rolename="manager-status"/>
<role rolename="admin-gui"/>
<role rolename="admin-script"/>
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status,admin-gui,admin-script"/>

</tomcat-users>
```

> **NOTE**: If you wish to use a different username and password please append the second last line to contain your preferred username and password.
> ```
> <user username="yourusername" password="yourpassword" roles="manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status,admin-gui,admin-script"/>
> ```

By default Tomcat only allows uploading of files up to 50mb. Our WAR file is slightly larger so we have to modify the according setting. Open the configuration file for the web-interface:

```
nano /usr/local/apache-tomcat-8.0/webapps/manager/WEB-INF/web.xml
```

Find this part in the file and simply add a zero to both numbers:

```
    <multipart-config>
      <!-- 50MB max -->
      <max-file-size>52428800</max-file-size>
      <max-request-size>52428800</max-request-size>
      <file-size-threshold>0</file-size-threshold>
    </multipart-config>
```

#### Start and test Tomcat

Start tomcat8:

```
echo tomcat8_enable="YES" >> /etc/rc.conf
echo tomcat8_env="LANG=en_US.UTF-8 TZ=Europe/Paris" >> /etc/rc.conf
service tomcat8 start
```

Test if Tomcat is listening on port 8080:

```
netstat -an | grep 8080
```

It should return a line containing the IP address of your system (or jail).

> ie ```tcp4	0	0 10.0.0.10.8080	-.-	LISTEN ```

> If in a jail it may also return the line "netstat: kvm not available: /dev/mem: No such file or directory" This can be ignored.

#### Create directories and set up permissions

Create directories and set up permissions:

```
mkdir /var/airsonic
chown -R www:www /var/airsonic
chown -R www:www /usr/local/apache-tomcat-8.0/webapps
```

#### Deploy Airsonic

Open a web browser and go to http://SERVER_IP:8080, replace `SERVER_IP` with your server IP address.

You should be greeted by the Apache Tomcat page. Click on the Manager App button on the right of the page and enter the username and password used in step 3. Default was username: admin and password: admin

Scroll down to Deploy and the subheading "WAR file to deploy" hit choose file and select the airsonic.war downloaded in the preamble. After selecting press the deploy button. Scroll up and press start. When the page refreshes a message "OK - Started application at context path /airsonic-v6.2.beta1" should be visible.

#### Navigate to Airsonic

In a browser. Take your `SERVER_IP` and `PORT` and append the the context path from above.

> ie if the War deployed was called airsonic-v6.1.beta2.war navigate to:
> 10.0.0.10:8080/airsonic-v6.1.beta2/

#### Log into Airsonic

Log in. The default is username: admin password: admin

Follow the prompts on the web page to change the password. This will log you out. Please re-login with your new password

#### Set up media

If you are on FreeBSD in a jail, consult the documentation for your Jail Manager tool on how to pass through storage. If using FreeNAS please use the FreeNAS webui to pass through the dataset containing your music.

In Airsonic click `2. Setup Media folders`.

Name your media folder and put in the path to your music. Then click "Scan media folders now"

Congratulations you have set up Airsonic.

## Transcoding Support

If you want transcoding and DON'T need mp3 support:

```
pkg install ffmpeg
ln -s /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg /var/airsonic/transcode/ffmpeg
service tomcat8 restart
```

Congratulations you have transcoding enabled

If you need mp3 support and most likely you will the process is more arduous as FreeBSD's ffmpeg doesn't contain mp3 support by default and must be configured and compiled by the user.

#### Install ffmpeg dependencies and Ports Tree

Install the dependencies required to build and use ffmpeg:

```
pkg install yasm binutils texi2html frei0r v4l_compat gmake pkgconf perl5 fontconfig freetype2 opencv-core schroedinger libtheora libv4l libva libvdpau libvorbis libvpx libx264 xvid gnutls libiconv dav1d cmake x265 nasm
```

Now install the FreeBSD Ports Tree

```
portsnap fetch
portsnap extract
```

#### Build ffmpeg

Navigate to the ffmpeg port directory

```
cd /usr/ports/multimedia/ffmpeg
```

Configure ffmpeg build

```
make configure
```

This will bring up a menu. Scroll down using arrow keys to "LAME" and hit the spacebar to enable it. Press enter to continue.

The ffmpeg source files will automatically be downloaded then you will be presented with an additional prompt to install documentation. I uncheck with spacebar then press enter to continue.

Start build and installation of ffmpeg

```
make install clean
```

Building ffmpeg will take some time depending on the capabilities of your machine, please be patient.

Symlink ffmpeg to where Airsonic expects the transcoder to be.

```
ln -s /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg /var/airsonic/transcode/ffmpeg
```

Finally restart tomcat

```
service tomcat8 restart
```

Congratulations you have ffmpeg with mp3 support installed ready for Airsonic to use.
