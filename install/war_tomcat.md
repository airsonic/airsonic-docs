##### Prerequisites

In order to install and run Airsonic with Tomcat, you will need:
- [A JDK installation, 1.8.x series of OpenJDK or Oracle JDK 8+ should work.](/docs/install/prerequisites)
- A running [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) server. If you're unfamiliar with Tomcat, there are many [guides](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tags/java?q=How+to+install+tomcat8&type=tutorials) on it.

#### Deploy Airsonic WAR package

##### On Debian 8 / Ubuntu > 16.04

Download the latest Airsonic .war package from the [download page](/download), or with the command below:

```
wget {{ site.repo }}/download/v{{ site.stable_version }}/airsonic.war
```

Create the Airsonic directory and assign ownership to the Tomcat system user (if running tomcat as a service):

```
sudo mkdir /var/airsonic/
sudo chown -R tomcat8:tomcat8 /var/airsonic/
```

Stop the tomcat8 service:

```
sudo systemctl stop tomcat8.service
```

Remove the possible existing airsonic files from the TOMCAT_HOME:

```
sudo rm /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/airsonic.war
sudo rm -R /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/airsonic/
sudo rm -R /var/lib/tomcat8/work/*
```

Move the downloaded WAR file in the TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/ folder:

```
sudo mv airsonic.war /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/airsonic.war
```

Restart the tomcat8 service:

```
sudo systemctl start tomcat8.service
```

> Note that it may take ~30 seconds after the service restarts for Tomcat to fully deploy the app. You can monitor /var/log/tomcat8/catalina.out for the following message:
```
INFO: Deployment of web application archive /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/airsonic.war has finished in 46,192 ms
```

Airsonic should be running at [http://localhost:8080/airsonic](http://localhost:8080/airsonic) if installed locally, replace `localhost` with your server IP address if installed remotly.
