For developing with Intellij (running and debugging), there are two options listed below.

> **NOTE**: Intellij Ultimate 2018.2 was used for these instructions. Intellij Community 2018.2 should work fine for the first option. The second requires Ultimate

#### Use embedded Spring Boot

In the new project dialog, click `Check out from Version Control`:

Enter in the url for the airsonic source code, and click `Clone`:

Import project using `Maven`:

Check `Import Maven projects automatically` and click `Next`:

In the remaining dialog boxes, the default options are fine. Click next through them. At this point you should see intellij load up.


At the right side of the window, expand `Maven Projects` and ensure both `ide-tomcat-embed` and `tomcat-embed` profiles are checked:

Expand the `Airsonic (root)` and Lifecycle tree and run `package`:

Edit the runtime profiles. There should already be a Spring Boot runtime profile called `Application`. If not, create it by locating the `org.airsonic.player.Application` class and clicking the green play button next to the class name.

Once it exists, expand the Environment section and ensure `Include dependencies with "Provided"` scope is unchecked. Set the `Working directory` to the location of the `airsonic-main` subdirectory. Also if you want to change your `airsonic.home` do so now by adding `-Dairsonic.home=YOUR_DIRECTORY` to the VM options.

Click `Ok`.

Now you can run or debug the application:

#### Use external Spring Boot

IntelliJ can be used as a remote debugger on a running server, which can come in handy.

> **NOTE**: This degrades performance slightly while the debugger is attached.

First, follow the instructions in the last part to setup IntelliJ locally.

Then, on the remote server, edit the Java command line used to run Airsonic and add the following options:

```
java -jar airsonic.war
    ...other options...
    -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:51423
```

> **WARNING**: This exposes port 51423 without any password. This must **never** be exposed outside of your local network. Enabling remote debugging allows remote control of anything on your server!

Once this is done, in IntelliJ, open a new configuration and fill the name of your remote server, along with port 51423:

#### Use external Tomcat
