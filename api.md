#### Subsonic API

We will try not to break with the Subsonic API.

Airsonic currently embed Subsonic API version {{ site.subsonic_api_version }}.

> **NOTE**: Some features where removed or not integrated, so some endpoint of the API will return some errors:
- getChatMessages returns 410 Gone
- addChatMessage returns 410 Gone
- getVideoInfo returns 501 Not implemented
- getCaptions returns 501 Not implemented

If you want to use the API please find the [API documentation on the Subsonic website](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp).

##### Generate a Subsonic API token

> **NOTE**: This is and extension of the [original subsonic API documentation](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp) regarding token authentication.

In order to work with the Subsonic API, we recommend the token and salt as authentication system, instead of using your password in plain text.

> **NOTE**: Using md5 as hashing algorithm for authentication is a subsonic API limitation, and it isn't recommended in modern authentication system.

First you need to generate a salt string, with a minimal length of 10 chars, using one of the following command:
```sh
openssl rand -base64 10
openssl rand -hex 10
head /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c 10 ; echo
```

The token is generated using the md5sum of your password concatenated to the previous salt string `token = md5(password + salt)`. Use the following command to generate the token:
```sh
echo -n <password><salt> | md5sum | awk '{ print $1 }')
```

> **NOTE**: The awk command is using to remove the md5 source name from the output, in our case from stdin `-`.

You can now pass your username, the token and salt to your api requests:
```sh
curl 'http://your-server/rest/ping.view?u=<username>&t=<token>&s=<salt>&v=1.15.0&c=<your-app>'
```

Here is a full example:
```sh
SERVER='https://example.tld'
CLIENT='CLI'
USERNAME='admin'
PASSWORD='password'
SALT="$(openssl rand -hex 20)"
TOKEN="$(echo -n "${PASSWORD}${SALT}" | md5sum | awk '{ print $1 }')"
echo ${SALT}
echo ${TOKEN}
curl "${SERVER}/rest/ping.view?u=${USERNAME}&t=${TOKEN}&s=${SALT}&v=1.15.0&c=${CLIENT}"
```
